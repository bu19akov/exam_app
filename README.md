# Exam App
Many people are fond of interactive learning. The application will generate a mathematical expression for a user to solve. There are two levels of difficulty and the application saves the results to a file.

## Usage

```bash
exam_app.py
Which level do you want? Enter a number:
1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9
2 - integral squares of 11-29
(number)
```
